## Name: WSAdblock (Web Shield Ads block)

1. **Idea:** Helps protect the website you are visiting and minimizes annoying ads
2. **How it works**
   - The application is built as a browser extension or a direct app on the computer
   - Users can download it through the chain's website
   - After installation, the App or extension works by recording the number of times it blocks extraneous web pages or ads and converts them into points
   - The points can be converted into the project's tokens, NFTs, Tickets, etc. after the user connects with the wallet and chain
   - Profits are distributed to the chain's components from here.
   
3. **Problem**
   - On web 2, there are extensions to block ads (famous ones like Adblock Plus, Adguard block). It's necessary to have an ad-blocking software that also warns websites when aiming for web 3.
   - As a long-term adblock user, I see its utility, however, recent policies from parties like YouTube make me uncomfortable, hence this idea.
   - Amid various concepts of web 2.5, web 3, however, the web now mostly profits from ads. Sometimes these websites are related to toxic ads or jump to unidentified websites, so using adblock to protect users is still very interesting.
   - Due to the difficulty in competing with famous adblock extensions currently, using blockchain will attract users along with the trend of profit-sharing from the platform, so using blockchain is a good choice now.
   - Due to user privacy issues and no need to identify who the user is, using some blockchain platform will be more convenient for rewarding as well as converting the platform.
